# Extending busybar-claude-status

Two extension axes: **more agents** (Codex, Cursor, anything) via the
reporting protocol, and **more links to the device** via transports.

```
claude-code (built-in adapter) --.
codex / cursor / your script ----+--> POST /v1/report --> SessionStore --> Renderer --> Transport
                                      (the standard)      (normalized)    (core logic) (usb/wifi/cloud/ble)
```

The display core only ever sees the normalized schema below. Provider
quirks (Claude's `/effort` palette colors, its 5h/7d plan windows, its
statusline JSON) live in adapters and never reach the renderer.

Reusable device and display components:

- `busybar_http.py` handles device HTTP calls and USB source-address binding.
  Writes are attempted once; callers retry their current desired state.
- `busybar_input.py` buffers WebSocket frames across socket timeouts and
  dispatches ordered input events. Routing stays with the consuming screen.
- `display_scene.py` combines changed native element groups into one request.
  It caches only accepted updates, with independent keepalive periods for
  text and animations. Reconnection does not replay obsolete visual states.
- [Pixel scenes](PIXEL_UI.md) share font layout, transitions and rendering
  between native `.anim` playback and offline previews.

`BUSYBAR_PORT` selects the local report port (default 8765),
`BUSYBAR_APP_NAME` the canvas/asset namespace (default `claude_status`), and
`BUSYBAR_DRAW_PRIORITY` the canvas priority (default 50). The standalone gallery
launcher sets its own values and `BUSYBAR_MANAGED=1`; managed workers use the
launcher's environment instead of reading an adjacent `env.sh`.

## 1. Reporting protocol (v1)

Anything that can run one HTTP request can drive the display:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/report -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "source":     "codex",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "state":      "WORKING",
  "label":      "GPT5 codex",
  "label_color":"#99CCFF",
  "context_pct": 63,
  "quotas":     [{"name":"wk","left_pct":42}]
}'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | string ≤32 | yes | tool id, e.g. `codex`, `cursor` |
| `session_id` | string ≤128 | yes | unique within the source |
| `state` | enum | no | `THINKING WORKING WAIT ERROR FAILED COMPLETE IDLE` — drives the ring animation + state word; omit to update data only |
| `label` | string ≤64 | no | line-1 text (tool/model name); ASCII; auto-trimmed to fit |
| `label_color` | `#RRGGBB[AA]` | no | line-1 color (default white) |
| `context_pct` | 0–100 | no | retained in the normalized status API; the front display prioritizes weekly quota gauges |
| `quotas` | array | no | each `{name ≤6, left_pct: 0-100 or null, resets_at?: unix_s, window_minutes?, observed_at?: unix_s, valid_until?: unix_s}`; only a weekly window drives the two gauges; null/expired means unknown |
| `quota_status` | object | no | diagnostic `source`, `limit_id`, `state`, `observed_at`, `error`; forwarded unchanged by standby mirrors |
| `badges` | array of names | no | known: `fast`, which selects the yellow animated working contour; unknown names are ignored |
| `ttl_s` | seconds | no | session forgotten after this silence (default 6h) |
| `ended` | bool | no | `true` removes the session immediately |
| `host` | string ≤64 | no | computer the session lives on (or header `X-Busybar-Host`) |
| `host_tag` | string ≤9 | no | display marker for that computer: `#RRGGBB` flag or 1–2 letters (or header `X-Busybar-Host-Tag`) |
| `rev`, `lease_s`, `focus_age_s`, `state_age_s`, `active_age_s` | mirror only | no | sent by a standby daemon under header `X-Busybar-Mirror: 1` (see "Standby" below); direct clients never send them |

Semantics:

- Reports **merge**: send `state` from lifecycle hooks and data fields
  from wherever you compute them, at different rates.
- With several sessions/tools reporting, the display **follows
  attention**: among sessions whose state is not `IDLE`, the one with the
  newest *attention event* wins — a report of `THINKING` or `WAIT`, or
  `WORKING` arriving while the session was `IDLE`/`COMPLETE` (a task
  starting). Data-only reports and repeated `WORKING` never move the
  display; a background session surfaces once the focused one is idle.
  `GET /status` shows which one is shown (`source`, `host`).
- Every field except `source`/`session_id` degrades gracefully when
  missing — a state-only reporter still gets the ring + state word.
- `COMPLETE` auto-decays to `IDLE` after 30 s; `IDLE` releases the
  screen after 10 min.

`GET /status` returns the same normalized shape (what the renderer and
the on-device app consume), plus `week_progress_pct` and quota age. Reaching
`resets_at` or `valid_until` clears that window's `left_pct` to null; the daemon
never invents a replenished quota or advances the reset by seven days.
`GET /health` lists all live sessions.

### Writing an adapter

An adapter is just "run curl at the right moments":

- **Claude Code** (built-in): statusline command forwards its JSON to
  `/statusline`, hooks post `/state?state=X` — the daemon maps both onto
  the normalized schema (`claude_statusline_report()` in `daemon.py`).
  Claude's specialness — effort→color from the CLI's own palette, the
  model-follows-plan 5h/7d windows — is entirely inside that function.
- **Codex Desktop/CLI**: shipped — `adapters/codex_status.py`. Zero-config: it
  reads `~/.codex/config.toml` and the selected task's rollout, deriving
  everything generically so model renames never break it: the label is
  prettified from the raw id (`gpt-5.6-sol` → `5.6 Sol` + effort),
  `service_tier` ≠ default becomes a badge (`fast` → yellow working contour),
  context % comes from `last_token_usage / model_context_window`, and
  quotas from a separate `account/rateLimits/read` poll every minute, including
  while idle. It selects the `codex` account bucket, names windows from
  `windowDurationMins` (10080 → `7d`), and retains the actual reset and freshness
  deadlines. Historical `token_count.rate_limits` are ignored. Run it alongside the daemon:
  `python3 adapters/codex_status.py` — or better, make it
  **auto-start**: `python3 adapters/install_codex_autostart.py install`
  wires Codex's `notify` hook to `adapters/codex_notify.py`
  (cross-platform), which
  chains your previous notifier (preserved verbatim), keeps the daemon +
  adapter alive on every Codex turn, and pushes the turn's end state
  instantly. `uninstall` restores everything. (Codex *skills* are
  model-invoked instruction packages and *plugins* are connector
  manifests — neither can run a background service, so the notify hook
  is the native auto-start point.)
- **Cursor**: use Cursor Hooks (`hooks.json`, e.g. `beforeShellExecution`
  / `stop`) to post `WORKING` / `COMPLETE` with
  `label: "Cursor"`, or wrap `cursor-agent` invocations.
- **Anything else** (CI, long scripts): `trap` + curl gets you a state
  lamp in three lines of shell.

Keep one stable `session_id` per logical session so merging works.

### Several computers: one hub, many forwarders

The daemon is a hub as soon as it listens on the LAN
(`BUSYBAR_LISTEN=0.0.0.0`, or `setup_claude.py install --lan`). Any other
computer sets `BUSYBAR_HUB=http://<hub>:8765` and runs no daemon at all:
`report.py`/`report.sh` and the Codex adapter simply post there. Every
report may carry two headers, which the hub stores per session:

| Header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Busybar-Host` | the reporting computer (`BUSYBAR_HOST`, default hostname) |
| `X-Busybar-Host-Tag` | display marker: `#RRGGBB[AA]` = a 2×5 flag left of the label; 1–2 chars = text after the label |
| `X-Busybar-Token` | shared secret, required for non-loopback reports when the hub sets `BUSYBAR_HUB_TOKEN` |
| `X-Busybar-Mirror` | `1` on reports a standby daemon mirrors; the hub stores them as `mirrored` and never mirrors them onward (no loops) |

`/v1/report` accepts the same as JSON fields `host` / `host_tag`.
`POST /shutdown` (loopback only) makes the daemon exit so the next
activity respawns it with a fresh `env.sh`. Hub mode is orthogonal to
the transport: with `BUSYBAR_TRANSPORT=wifi` the hub can be any always-on
box rather than the computer the Bar is plugged into.

### Standby: a second daemon that paints while the hub is out

`BUSYBAR_HUB=<url>` plus `BUSYBAR_STANDBY=1` (`setup_claude.py install
--hub URL --standby --transport wifi --device <Bar LAN IP> --device-token
<key>`) turns a daemon into a standby. `report.py`/`report.sh` then talk
to the local daemon as usual; the daemon (`HubLink` in `daemon.py`) does
the rest:

- **Mirror.** Every session that originates locally is posted to the
  hub's `/v1/report` as a full record: coalesced per session, in order,
  `state` included only when it differs from what the hub last
  acknowledged (so any hub version sees exactly the transitions a direct
  client would have sent — no focus theft from repeated `WAIT`), ages
  (`focus_age_s`, `state_age_s`, `active_age_s`, computed at send time)
  instead of timestamps so clock skew between computers cancels out, a
  per-session `rev` (`max(prev+1, now_ms)`) so a late or duplicated
  delivery can never move a record backwards or resurrect an ended one
  (tombstones are kept 5 min), and `lease_s: 90` refreshed by a heartbeat
  every 30 s so a standby that dies takes its sessions with it. The hub
  derives `focus_ts`/`state_ts`/`last_active` from the ages and uses the
  mirrored `focus_ts` instead of its own attention rule, and answers
  `{"ok": true, "created": bool}` — `created` tells the standby the hub
  had forgotten that session (lease, its own sleep), so the state is sent
  again. Mirror fields are honoured only under the `X-Busybar-Mirror`
  header; `lease_s` is capped at 900 s.
- **Takeover.** The hub is probed (`GET /hub`, `GET /health` on older
  hubs) every 3 s while idle; deliveries count as probes. After three
  consecutive failures the standby paints — but a failure only counts
  while the Bar itself answers `GET /api/version`, so a standby whose own
  network is down (or that just woke from sleep) never takes over by
  mistake. The hub saying `device_ok: false` (Bar unplugged) also
  (three probes in a row, same debounce) also triggers a takeover. The
  first frame is preceded by one `DELETE` of the app so the hub's
  leftovers (possibly another style's elements) go. A standby waking from
  its own sleep discards all prior evidence and re-mirrors everything.
- **Yield.** On the first successful probe the standby, under its render
  lock (so no draw of its own is in flight), resyncs every session with
  transitions, then `POST /redraw`s the hub — which clears and repaints
  the shared canvas from scratch — and only then stops painting. It never
  deletes the app while the hub is up, including at exit.
- A changed `instance` in `GET /hub` (hub restarted) triggers a resync; a
  `style` mismatch is logged once; `role: standby` on the probed side
  (two standbys pointing at each other) or the daemon's own instance
  disables the link with a log line.

Endpoints added for this: `GET /hub` → `{instance, role, style,
render_mode, device_ok, device_error, rendering}` (any daemon);
`POST /redraw` (token-authorized like every POST) → clear + full
repaint, or clear when there is nothing to show; `GET /standby` on a
standby → its view of the hub, queue and last error. All LAN/loopback
requests bypass HTTP proxies on purpose.

Test rig on one computer: `daemon.py --port 8766` with
`BUSYBAR_LISTEN=127.0.0.1 BUSYBAR_HUB=http://127.0.0.1:8765
BUSYBAR_STANDBY=1 BUSYBAR_TRANSPORT=wifi BUSYBAR_DEVICE=<Bar LAN IP>
BUSYBAR_TOKEN=<key>` next to the real hub; post hooks to `:8766`, then
`kill -STOP` / `kill -CONT` the hub to play sleep and wake, watching
`GET /api/screen` on the Bar and `GET :8766/standby`.

## 2. Transports

Selected with `BUSYBAR_TRANSPORT` (default `usb`):

| Transport | Config | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `usb` | none | `http://10.0.4.20/api`, no auth, lowest latency |
| `wifi` | `BUSYBAR_DEVICE` (the Bar's LAN IP), `BUSYBAR_TOKEN` (access key) | the Bar answers 403 over Wi-Fi until access is enabled: over USB, `curl -X POST 'http://10.0.4.20/api/access?mode=key&key=12345678'` (4–10 digits; the device web UI → Network does the same); the key travels in the `X-API-Token` header |
| `cloud` | `BUSYBAR_TOKEN` (API token from the BUSY account) | `https://api.busy.app/busybar`, `Authorization: Bearer`; works anywhere, highest latency |
| `ble` | — | designed below, not implemented |

All transports speak the same HTTP API, so the `.anim` assets, the
theme, and every field note in the README apply unchanged. Note for
`wifi`/`cloud`: the on-device JS app polls the daemon at the USB host
address (`10.0.4.21`) — over other links, adjust `STATUS_URL` in
`device_app/scripts/main.js` to an address your device can reach.

### BLE transport design (future work)

The firmware tunnels **raw HTTP/1.1 over BLE** to its loopback web
server (`applications/services/ble/http/ble_http_repeater.c`), framed
over a Nordic UART Service. Verified against firmware source:

- Service `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
  - RX (write)  `6E400002-…` — central → device bytes
  - TX (notify) `6E400003-…` — device → central bytes
  - CNT `6E400004-…` — **session counter**: the repeater publishes a
    request number after each connection to the loopback server closes;
    writing `0` forces a session reset on the device side
- Enable BLE via `POST /api/ble/enable`, pair via `/api/ble/pairing` +
  on-device confirmation (bonding required; forget-pairing was crashy
  before 1.2.x).
- Protocol per request: serialize a full HTTP/1.1 request
  (`Content-Length` framing, `Connection: keep-alive` semantics are
  managed by the repeater), write it to RX in MTU-sized chunks, then
  reassemble TX notifications until the response's `Content-Length` is
  satisfied. One request in flight at a time; on a 4 s TX-confirm stall
  the device resets the session — resubscribe, sync CNT, retry.
- Implementation sketch (Python): `bleak` (the one optional dependency),
  a `BleHttpTransport(HttpTransport)` whose `_request` routes through the
  tunnel instead of a socket; reconnect/backoff loop; serialize with a
  lock. Expect a few KB/s — fine for status frames (~1 KB), slow for the
  one-time 60 KB anim upload (do that once over USB, or wait it out).
- Suggested test ladder: `GET /api/version` → `POST /display/draw` text →
  anim swap → daemon soak.

The daemon needs no other changes — `make_transport()` is the only
switch point.

## 3. What stays core

The renderer's contract (do not grow provider knowledge into it):

- state → ring animation + state word + colors
- `label`/`label_color` → line 1
- `context_pct` → normalized status data (not rendered in the compact front layout)
- weekly `quotas` → remaining-capacity and reset-progress bars

If a new provider needs something the schema can't express, extend the
schema (v2) — don't special-case the renderer.
